        | Primary focus as a Junior Developer working on mobile applications built using 
        | Googleâ€™s new open source, cross-platform mobile framework Flutter. 
        | This role has required learning quite a few new technologies (Dart & Flutter, Objective C), while
        | also strengthening my existing skills, such as problem-solving, version control(git)
        | and my proficiency with Python.
