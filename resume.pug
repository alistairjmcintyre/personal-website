        | Working as part of a small team to create and maintain 2 mobile applications using 
        | Google's new cross-platform mobile framework, Flutter. As part of this 
        | role we built a mobile app to give growers access to their fields
        | real-time data through the GrowerView platform. 
        | We also built an internal tool for agronomists to be able to access
        | and modify soil moisture readings in the cloud, and to aid them in 
        | making decisions in the field using both historical and real time
        | data.

        | GrowerView is a cross-platform mobile application built using Flutter & Firebase for 
        | customers of ProAg Croplogic to view the real time soil moisture readings
        | from their fields, and so they can be automatically notified if something
        | had gone wrong with their fields.

        | Working in a team of 8 students, we created 
        | a 2D top-down view for the live data feed from the 35th America's Cup.
        | Once the America's Cup had concluded, we pivoted to making a 3D multiplayer
        | sailing game with support for LAN and Online play.
        br 
        | For most of the team this was our first exposure to working on a larger,
        | longer term project (where early decisions could have greater consequences),
        | and to the Software Development Life Cycle and Agile methodologies (Scrum).

        | As an introduction to API First web development we were tasked with 
        | completing a basic crowdfunding web application, first building the API to a 
        | given specification and then the web application to use that API.
